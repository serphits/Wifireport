It works by using thousands of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites positioned 340-550 km above Earth to beam internet signals to user terminals (dishes) on the ground. The satellites communicate with ground stations and with each other using laser links, creating a mesh network in space that delivers internet connectivity even to remote locations."

Competitive gamers may notice slightly higher latency compared to fiber connections, but it's significantly better than traditional satellite internet (500-600ms). Games like Fortnite, Call of Duty, and League of Legends are playable. Performance is best during non-peak hours and with a clear view of the sky."

Light rain and clouds usually have minimal effect. The dish has a built-in heater to melt snow and ice. Overall, Starlink performs better in bad weather than traditional satellite internet due to its lower orbital altitude and stronger signal strength."

The standard dish can be used while stationary (in-motion use requires the flat high-performance dish). You can use Starlink anywhere within the coverage area and change your service address as you travel. Note: Residential plans require a fixed service address."

However, users consuming over 1TB per month during peak hours (7am-11pm) may experience slower speeds during congestion (deprioritization). Starlink Business plans offer priority data with higher speeds guaranteed even during congestion. Basic unlimited use is included in all plans without overage fees."

            "text": "Starlink advantages: Available in rural areas without cell coverage, more consistent speeds, lower latency than 4G/5G in some areas, no dependence on cell tower proximity. 5G advantages: Often faster speeds (100-1000 Mbps), lower latency in ideal conditions (10-20ms), lower cost ($50-70/month), no installation required. Choose Starlink if you lack reliable cellular coverage; choose 5G if available and affordable in your area."

                            <li><strong>Choose a location:</strong> Find a spot with a clear view of the sky. Use the Starlink app to check for obstructions (trees, buildings, etc.).</li>
                            <li><strong>Mount the dish:</strong> You can place it on the ground with the included tripod, mount it on your roof, or use a pole mount (sold separately).</li>
                            <li><strong>Run the cable:</strong> Connect the cable from the dish to your indoor router location. The standard cable is 75 feet (23m) long.</li>
                            <li><strong>Power up:</strong> Plug in both the router and dish using the provided power supply.</li>
                            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Download the Starlink app and follow the on-screen instructions. The dish will automatically orient itself to find satellites.</li>

                            The lower orbital altitude (340-550km vs 35,000km for traditional satellites) means stronger signals and better weather performance. Most users report weather disruptions are rare and brief.

                            <li><strong>Check for obstructions:</strong> Use the Starlink app to view obstructions. Even small tree branches can impact performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Verify network congestion:</strong> Speeds may be slower during peak hours (evening). Try testing at different times of day.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inspect the dish:</strong> Make sure it's clean, properly mounted, and has power. The app shows if the dish is working correctly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Restart equipment:</strong> Unplug the router and dish, wait 10 seconds, then plug back in.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check for weather:</strong> Heavy rain or snow can temporarily reduce speeds.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test with ethernet:</strong> Connect directly to the router via ethernet to rule out WiFi issues.</li>
